--> Ideas and todo to this project

~> Objectives
    1. Analyze published papers of researches in Brazil (and their grad area) to understand how researchers networks emerge.
    2. Understand how Brazilian unis generate interdisciplinary knowledge, if they do.

~> Focal questions
    1. Do Brazilian researchers form inter-campi and inter-universities?
    2. If yes, how do they do it?
    3. Do professors in Brazil change (or collaborate to other) areas of study 
    4. Do larger connections increase the number of (sub-)areas studied by researches? * Possible paper1
    5. Is there a correlation between the amount of money invested in science and number of papers? * Possible paper2

~> What data to collect
    1. Professor info:
        - name, uni/campus, area of graduation, year of graduation, papers published
    2. All papers' keywords of each professor
    3. Brazilian (professors in Brazilian unis) co-authors on these papers

~> Data collection procedures
    1. Get the list of still working professors in Brazilian unis
    2. Enter their Lattes and collect the doi addresses of papers
    3. To each paper get the authors and keywords (how to???)
    
~> Data storage
    1. DB with tables by uni 
        professor_info|co-authorship|keywords
    2. other?

~> Data analysis
    1. Nodes by professor/uni/area and connections by co-authorship
    2. Nodes by unis and connections through their professors co-authoring papers
    3. "Large" Areas (CNPq) with the most works on different subjects
    4. Correlation with professors' indicators and collaborations
    5. Number of papers by year to each uni (normalized by the # professors) and the percentual of GDP (value?)

~> Tools needed
    1. Languages we may have to work with: python (preferred) and R
    2. WebScrapping of Sikuli (others?)
    3. Matplotlib and Sci2 Tool to graphs and network representation
    4. Other?
